A project made as part of the Atos/QA Grad2Guru Training Program.

The aim of this project is to create a CRUD Application with a chosen domain - I will be implementing a book library model. Users will be able to create, read, update and delete customers in the library database using the java application.

I have also included screenshots of an ER and UML diagram that both visualise the model of this database. In addition, I have also included a .gitignore file and a risk assessment of the project.

For the CRUD Application I have aimed to achieve 60% coverage in testing and managed to achieve 71.7%, making the project mostly robust and usable for end users.

The project includes a runnable jar file at the root of the repository, allowing even non-technical users to utilise the application at ease.

Screenshots of my completed Jira Scrum Board whilst working on this project can be seen below:
